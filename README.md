Khuzdul (Dwarven) Outpost is a "Location Module" for the Foundry VTT system. It is designed to depict
a long-abandoned Khuzdul (Dwarven) outpost. This location module is designed for the
[HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy setting; however, this manor
could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic.  Detailed descriptions of the actors
has been provided in journal entries to facilitate conversion to other game systems.

This outpost could be located anywhere, but on Hârn the most likely locations would be
Orbaal or Kaldor.
