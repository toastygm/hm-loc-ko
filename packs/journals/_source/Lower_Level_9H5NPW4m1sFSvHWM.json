Since the site was abandoned, this area has been overgrown with trees, burned down by forest fires and grown over again. Eleven hundred years of winter, wind, water and weather have completed the masterful concealment job started by the Khuzdul. Sheltered from the wind and rain, the courtyard makes an excellent campsite.</p>",

Due to the shear weight of the door, it would take the combined strength of ten men to force it open from the inside. Once open, the hinges will need to be replaced before it can be fully closed again. Although cut from natural limestone, the stone appears to have been changed to pseudo-stone, possibly by the Earthmaster device from Kiraz. It would take considerable force (at least a battering ram) to break down the door, assuming the correct place on the cliff wall could be determined. During Codominium times, this door was often left open during the day.</p>",
