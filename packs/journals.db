{"_id":"EbJImi5hl3L8xXEB","name":"Outpost","content":"<p>The outpost was always well concealed. Carefully crafted and balanced stone doors conceal the main entrance and the backdoor. The four crossbow loops overlooking the area in front of the main door were designed to look like simple cracks in the cliff face. When not in use, each loop has a stone shutter, which matches the surrounding cliff face and makes it very difficult to spot. Before departing, the Khuzdul dismantled the two chimneys, which once stood on the top of the cliff, and covered the holes with large heavy boulders.</p>\n<p>The maps show the furnishings as they appeared in Codominium times. When the Khuzdul left, they removed all portable furniture and whatever wood remained has long since crumbled to dust. Although the Khuzdul produce the best steel on Hârn, even their work cannot withstand millennia without maintenance. All hinges, bolts and strapping are covered with a thick layer of rust and are badly weakened. The doors are made with bronze covered oak. The bronze has turned a deep green and the oak has slowly rotted away in the damp. A solid shove with cause them to collapse. The chimneys are only one foot in diameter and were drilled from the top down. Six inches below the surface, a grill of one-inch thick enamelled steel alloy bars secures the chimneys. Whether by enchantment or virtue of their special coating, these grills are rust free.</p>\n<p>The facility was well located and constructed with great care and skill. There has been very little shifting over the centuries, so the walls and ceilings are still in good condition. Several narrow shafts in the ceiling lead out to the downwind side of the cliff where the low pressure naturally draws the air out. When there is a strong breeze the shafts create a whistling or moaning sound, which can be quite eerie. Despite being closed for a thousand years, the air in the outpost is relatively fresh. Located above the waterline, the entire outpost has a slight slope from the furthest point (the staircase) down to the main entrance. Any water that does penetrate the rock naturally flows down to small drains and out of the rooms. These drains and airshafts have allowed insects and small mammals access to the outpost over the years. A millennia of nests, droppings and food debris litter the floor.</p>\n<p><strong>Lower Level</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.ycBFDTFgMFhXoIsO]{Courtyard}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.mXTVms8LSzI2Rthb]{Stone Door}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.k6OUszvCVZzg8mia]{Portcullis}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.IsW4VmdujhoOxpA9]{Storeroom}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.jTQMzchE6lkRnwAj]{Mule Stable}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.cfBhRWuw9WHnN9lJ]{Main Hall}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.S7rhLr0vrHnkSNbe]{Dormitory}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.rhswMfuNp7zP9Ewx]{Private quarters}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.teC8Je9J3wUFIs3G]{Staircase}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.pB1l2yB299v7ZpYc]{Well}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.y0laGRTE4vDULs8f]{Kitchen}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.3LwRAaksRonUch1F]{Pantry}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.M4l3I8ZR5H1cqz2O]{Privy}</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Upper Level</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.b8s3buMknpB51PzH]{Escape Ladder}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.6bm0B6VMlu1hSRdV]{Guard Room}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.Pm7BPmpA1D0cYedp]{Crossbow Gallery}</li>\n</ul>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Kxt2Sk7LHtY7jpYX":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":0},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.T7dIXWeNlKJxSmGQ","hash":"70fd0aa1496a0ad98018bce39c97ebd07b5b6c32"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.ko-journals.EbJImi5hl3L8xXEB"}}}

Although it is a powerful little fortress, it is in need of repairs to make it fully serviceable again. Unless the PCs are craftsmen, they will have to bring in specialists (blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, etc) to do the repairs. How will they get them there without giving away the location? Replacing the doors, hinges, bolts, winches and furniture will be an expensive proposition, allowing the GM to siphon off excess PC cash and raise awkward questions with the authorities. Transporting a large winch to the outpost could be a challenge.</p>\n<p>Unless they plan to leave it unguarded while they are off adventuring, the PCs will need to hire NPC retainers to protect the outpost in their absence. This is another way to drain off excess cash. There is also the potential for treachery, if the NPCs think they can get away with it. The PCs might arrive at their hideout with gargun in hot pursuit only to find the doors barred and demands for an immediate pay raise posted.</p>\n<p>If the PCs don’t want to repair the outpost or live there full time, there is always the possibility of using it as a treasure cache.

The rungs are rusted through and will snap if any amount of weight is put on them. At the top of the ladder is a stone hatch made of pseudo-stone (like the main entrance). Tapered, the round hatch wedges tightly in the hole without hinges. There is a one-foot wide ledge around the shaft four feet below the hatch. A user stands astride the shaft on the ledge and lifts the hatch with his back. The top of the hatch blends perfectly into the surrounding rock. When the dwarves sealed the site, they departed via this exit, so they were unable to extend the three bolts that normally secure the hatch in place; instead they rolled a large boulder over top of it. It will take at least four strong men to remove the boulder. Then, they will have to find the edges of the hatch and pry it up.

A hunting lodge and way station, this small underground site was tunnelled out of the face of a hard blue limestone cliff during the Codominium era. It once housed 8-10 Khuzdul hunter-gatherers who used it as a base from which to collect and preserve food to supply to the large cities of Azadmere and Kiraz. After the Battle of Sorrows, it was decided that the outpost was too isolated and vulnerable, so everything of value was removed and the site was sealed for possible future use. The location of the site and floor plans are kept in the Royal Archive in Azadmere. No one has looked at them in several hundred years.</p>\n<section class=\"highlight\">\n<p>NOTE: The outpost is an ancient ruin, abandoned for over 1000 years.  All wooden furniture has long since crumbled and lies in unusable ruins, and valuables were removed when the outpost was abandoned.</p>\n</section>\n<h2>Key Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.EbJImi5hl3L8xXEB]{Outpost}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.8vssiU8recBmkeet]{Adventure Hooks}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-ko.journals.UMAv3r12eWiCtx1M]{Postscript}</li>\n</ul>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Kxt2Sk7LHtY7jpYX":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.7nmXwqHWUexhgBEv"}}}
